## Notes Merger
![notes merger preview](https://github.com/niffka/notes-merger/blob/main/src/img/generate_markdown.png)

This plugin enables you to merge multiple Markdown files into a single, unified Markdown file. The merge process is driven by the content specified in your index Markdown file and linked markdown files.

Process is split into two parts:
1. `Generate preview`: Create a hierarchy preview that visually represents the connections between notes and the links.
2. `Generate markdown`: Produce the final merged markdown file by incorporating the outcomes of step 1, along with the user's specified preferences and settings.
